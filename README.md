# PHP Refactoring Code Challenge

The objective here to refactor the code in a way that makes it more easily maintainable and efficient.
Organise it in a way that makes sense to you.

Please spend no more than an afternoon doing this.

Please make a duplicate of this repo, apply your changes and send me your revised repo. Don't simply create a merge request!

Have fun!
